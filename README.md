# Newspaper-Reading
This project includes newspaper api which and windows inbuilt sapi to read top headlines.
# Note
Currently this works only on Windows as SAPI voice recognition is used in this.
win32com is used from windows and some libraries like json for online news api and time for basic usage.
# More Ways to implement
More ways of doing this project is by importing pypptx library. In ground level this program only prints and reads some top headlines and some description.
